==================

.. py:module:: heapq_py

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).
   Heaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
   all k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,
   non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
   property of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.
   Usage:
   heap = []            # creates an empty heap
   heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
   item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap
   item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
   heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time
   item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds
   # new item; the heap size is unchanged
   Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:
   We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
   index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
   obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.
   Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.
   These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list
   without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()
   maintains the heap invariant!

.. py:function:: heappush(heap, item)

   Push item onto heap, maintaining the heap invariant.


.. py:function:: heappop(heap)

   Pop the smallest item off the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.


.. py:function:: heapreplace(heap, item)

   Pop and return the current smallest value, and add the new item.
   This is more efficient than heappop() followed by heappush(), and can be
   more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.  Note that the value
   returned may be larger than item!  That constrains reasonable uses of
   this routine unless written as part of a conditional replacement:
   if item > heap[0]:
   item = heapreplace(heap, item)


.. py:function:: heappushpop(heap, item)

   Fast version of a heappush followed by a heappop.


.. py:function:: heapify(x)

   Transform list into a heap, in-place, in O(len(x)) time.


.. py:function:: merge(*iterables, key=None, reverse=False)

   Merge multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output.
   Similar to sorted(itertools.chain(*iterables)) but returns a generator,
   does not pull the data into memory all at once, and assumes that each of
   the input streams is already sorted (smallest to largest).
   >>> list(merge([1,3,5,7], [0,2,4,8], [5,10,15,20], [], [25]))
   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25]
   If *key* is not None, applies a key function to each element to determine
   its sort order.
   >>> list(merge(['dog', 'horse'], ['cat', 'fish', 'kangaroo'], key=len))
   ['dog', 'cat', 'fish', 'horse', 'kangaroo']


.. py:function:: nsmallest(n, iterable, key=None)

   Find the n smallest elements in a dataset.
   Equivalent to:  sorted(iterable, key=key)[:n]


.. py:function:: nlargest(n, iterable, key=None)

   Find the n largest elements in a dataset.
   Equivalent to:  sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n]
