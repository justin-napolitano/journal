# Python Install

## Use Brew!!

We're going to use brew to install python.  Macos ships with python2 natively.   We won't be using it.  

Instead run...

:::{code-block} Bash

brew install python

## Python3 vs Python

Homebrew installs a new installation of python in your usr directory.  To run that gversion run python3 instead of python.

## pip3

Upgrade and install packages by running pip3.

Example:

:::{code-block} Bash

pip3 install <your-package-here>
