&lt;p&gt;Writing a cv in an honest way is frightening.  It requires one to confront their professional identity directly. Doing so, has left me painfully aware of the fact that I have much to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to writing the cv I thought that I had a solid understanding of the field.  I know now that I need to study in depth the mathematics and the applications used to drive ml models.  I can hack together a TensorFlow project, but actually explaining my results is more difficult than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/x-thebe-config"&gt;
    {
        requestKernel: true,
        binderOptions: {
            repo: "binder-examples/jupyter-stacks-datascience",
            ref: "master",
        },
        codeMirrorConfig: {
            theme: "abcdef",
            mode: "python"
        },
        kernelOptions: {
            kernelName: "python3",
            path: "./parts/journal"
        },
        predefinedOutput: true
    }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;kernelName = 'python3'&lt;/script&gt;</content>
